# go-preso

This project is intented to show how lazy I am, when it comes to coding up a preso in reveal.js... I want a framework!!!


# TODO

- User authentication - leaning towards "social-auth" from beego
- Preso editing - will probably be markdown or simple WYSIWYG editor for each slide
- Preso viewer - this will be a session based URL, where only 1 driver drives, but many passengers can watch.  Drivers can be switched.
- Logging
- Error handling
- Everything else I find along the way :)
